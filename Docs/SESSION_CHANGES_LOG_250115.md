## üîß Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Genre Card Text Cutoff Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Genre card titles were truncating on laptop view - "Fantasy & Magic Adventures" displayed as "Fnatasy & Magic Adve....."

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/genre/GenreCard.tsx`
- `src/components/genre/GenreGrid.tsx`

**Changes Applied**:
- **GenreCard.tsx**:
  - Removed `overflow-hidden` causing text cutoff
  - Improved responsive padding: `p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-6` ‚Üí `p-2 sm:p-3 md:p-4 lg:p-3 xl:p-4`
  - Optimized text sizing: `text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl` ‚Üí `text-xs sm:text-sm lg:text-xs xl:text-sm`
  - Added `leading-tight`, `hyphens-auto`, and proper word wrapping
  - Responsive aspect ratios: `aspect-[4/3] sm:aspect-[3/2] lg:aspect-[4/3] xl:aspect-[3/2]`

- **GenreGrid.tsx**:
  - Modified grid layout: `lg:grid-cols-4` ‚Üí `lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4`
  - Provided more width per card for better text display

### 2. Story Creation JavaScript Error (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Story cards stopped working with error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')" in CreatePrompt.tsx:259

**Root Cause**: Genre ID mismatches between data objects and current system
- `genreDisplayNames` and `genrePrompts` objects contained outdated genre IDs
- Old IDs: 'child-adapted', 'horror-story', etc.
- Current IDs: 'bedtime-stories', 'fantasy-magic', etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/CreatePrompt.tsx`

**Changes Applied**:
- Updated all genre ID mappings to match current system
- Added safety checks to prevent `.split()` errors on undefined values
- Ensured consistency across all genre-related data structures

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Improvements

### Multi-Layered Safety Implementation
1. **Proactive Safety**: Genre-specific prompt design prevents unsafe content at source
2. **Reactive Filtering**: Output validation catches any problematic content
3. **User Input Validation**: Frontend validation before processing
4. **Backend Validation**: Server-side safety checks
5. **Emergency Failsafes**: Critical safety measures for extreme cases

### Content Quality Enhancements
- **Educational Integration**: Natural learning woven into narratives
- **Character Consistency**: Maintained across story segments
- **Age-Appropriate Language**: Vocabulary suited for 4-12 year olds
- **Positive Messaging**: Focus on friendship, problem-solving, creativity
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Inclusive and respectful content

## üóëÔ∏è File Cleanup & Organization

### Deleted Components (as per additional_data)
The following home page components were removed during refactoring:
- `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`
- `src/components/home/ValuePropositionSection.tsx`
- `src/components/home/SafetyInfo.tsx`
- `src/components/home/CinematicHero.tsx`
- `src/components/home/RouteSelector.tsx`
- `src/components/home/SplitScreenOverlay.tsx`

**Reason**: These components were likely replaced with more streamlined home page architecture.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Development Issues

### Vite Development Server Problem
**Issue**: `npm run dev` fails with "'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command"`

**Potential Solutions**:
1. **Dependency Installation**: Run `npm install` or `bun install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. **Node Modules Repair**: Delete `node_modules` and reinstall
3. **Package Manager Switch**: Consider using `bun dev` instead of `npm run dev` (bun.lockb present)
4. **Global Vite Installation**: Install vite globally if needed

**Recommended Next Steps**:
```bash
# Try bun first (since bun.lockb exists)
bun install
bun dev

# If bun fails, try npm
npm install
npm run dev
```
