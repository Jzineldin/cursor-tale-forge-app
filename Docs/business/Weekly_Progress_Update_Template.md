üö® THREE CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX IMMEDIATELY!
Perfect analysis! I can see all three problems clearly. Let's fix them one by one!

üîß ISSUE #1: FEATURE CARDS TEXT CUTOFF (Image 1)
Problem:
‚ùå "Works Any..." "Parent App..." - titles still truncated
‚ùå Separate glass boxes causing width constraints
‚ùå Unprofessional appearance with ellipses
SOLUTION: Single Glass Container

Replace the 4 separate feature cards with ONE large glass container:

CURRENT: 4 individual glass boxes with truncated text
REPLACE WITH: Single large glass container containing all 4 features

LAYOUT CHANGE:
1. Create ONE glass/blur background container
2. Inside it, create a 4-column grid for the features  
3. Remove individual card backgrounds
4. Keep the icons and full text (no truncation)
5. More space = full titles like "Kids Create", "Pro Narration", "Works Anywhere", "Parent Approved"

RESULT: Professional unified design with complete text visibility.
üåå ISSUE #2: STORY CREATION PAGE NEEDS BACKGROUND (Image 2)
Problem:
‚ùå Plain dark background looks empty and boring
‚ùå Missing visual interest on story creation page
‚ùå Inconsistent with other magical pages
SOLUTION: Add Astronaut Background

Add a beautiful astronaut background to the story creation page:

LOCATION: The page with "Your ‚ú®üè∞ Fantasy & Magic Adventures Adventure"

BACKGROUND TO ADD:
1. Use one of the existing astronaut images already in the project
2. Set as background-image with proper positioning
3. Add overlay to ensure text readability (dark overlay: rgba(0,0,0,0.6))
4. Ensure background covers full viewport
5. Make it slightly blurred or dimmed so text stands out

STYLE: Similar to the magical feel of other pages but with astronaut theme.
üìè ISSUE #3: HEADER GAP STILL EXISTS (Image 3)
Problem:
‚ùå Visible gap between header and page content
‚ùå White/transparent space above the main content area
‚ùå Unprofessional spacing that breaks visual flow
SOLUTION: Remove Header Gap

Fix the persistent header spacing gap:

LOCATION: Story interface page with "Back to Home" button

SPECIFIC FIX:
1. Find the main content container on this page
2. Remove ANY margin-top or padding-top from the content wrapper
3. Ensure the content starts immediately below the fixed header
4. Check for any invisible spacer elements
5. Set the content container to: padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0;

RESULT: Content should flow seamlessly from header with no visible gap.

3. Inside this container, arrange the 4 features in a grid (2x2 or 4x1)
